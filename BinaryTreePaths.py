### Easy
### Problem: Given a binary tree, return all root to leaf paths in the form:Â ["1->4->5", "1->10"]
### https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/

### Beats 96% of submissions for time complexity
### O(B) space complexity where B is the number of paths, O(N) time complexity

### Advice: remember to look the clues in the question itself, told you what the terminal constraint was
### More importantly, remember that appending when the node is None (after we iterate on empty leaves)
### means that we append the data twice, making the output erroneous. Sometimes appending / returning
### data values after checking if children exist at all is better
